# SevenSegTools
A set of tools and fonts intended to make working with Seven Segments displays easier and faster.

This project is currently on its pretty early stages, so don't expect to find something useful in here at this time.

## Instructions
For running the Python files, first activate the virtual environment (venv) by running `source .venv/bin/activate`.

Once done, deactivate the venv by running `deactivate`.
